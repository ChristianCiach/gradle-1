Release Notes - Gradle - Version 0.5

** Incompatible Changes since 0.4
    * DependencyManager.addConfiguration() no longer accepts an Ivy Configuration object.
    * The tasksGraph property has been removed from tasks. You can access the task execution graph using the
      'project.build.taskGraph' property. See the javadoc for class TaskExecutionGraph for more details.
    * Tasks are no longer constructed with a Dag parameter as the 3rd constructor parameter. Task constructors are
      now called with the task name, and project.
    * The Dag parameter has been removed from TaskAction.execute().
