<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Gradle requires a Java JDK and a JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to the JDK. Gradle ships with its own Groovy
library. Therefore no Groovy needs to be installed. Any existing Groovy installation is ignored by Gradle. The standard
Gradle distribution require a JDK 1.5 or higher. Beginning with 0.3 we also provide a distinct JDK 1.4 compatible distribution.
<h2>Unpacking</h2>
The Gradle distribution comes only as zip. Additional to the binaries it is shipped with:
<ul>
<li>The userguide (HTML and PDF)</li>
<li>The Javadoc HTML pages.</li>
<li>The binary sources (If you want to build Gradle you need to download the source distribution or checkout the sources from the source repository)</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Un*x users</h3>
You need a GNU compatible tool to unzip Gradle, if you want the file permissions to be properly set. We mention this as
some zip front ends for Mac OS X don't restore the file permissions properly.

<h2>Environment variables</h2>
For running Gradle, the GRADLE_HOME environment variable needs to point to the root directory of your Gradle installation.
Then add <code>GRADLE_HOME/bin</code> to your path.

<h2>Running and testing your installation</h2>
You run Gradle via the <code>gradle</code> command.
To check if Gradle is properly installed just type <pre>gradle -v</pre> and you should get an output like:
<pre>
    Gradle 0.3-080820065915+0200
    Gradle buildtime: Wednesday, August 20, 2008 6:59:15 AM CEST
    Groovy 1.5.5
    Java 1.5.0_13
    JVM 1.5.0_13-121
    JVM Vendor: "Apple Computer, Inc."
    OS Name: Mac OS X
</pre>
<h2>JVM Options</h2>
<p>Un*x users can set JVM options for running Gradle by either defining an environment variable GRADLE_OPTS, or by setting the GRADLE_OPTS
variable at the beginning of the <code>gradle</code> script.</p>

<p>Windows users can set JVM options by adding a <code>gradle.l4j.ini</code> text file into the same directory where
<code>gradle.exe</code> is located. Such a file might look like this:
<pre>
    -Dsomevar="%SOMEVAR%"
    -Xms512m
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
You might check the userguide at <em>GRADLE_HOME</em><code>/docs/userguide</code>. Typing <code>gradle -h</code> prints
the command line help. Typing <code>gradle -t</code> shows all the tasks of a gradle build.
