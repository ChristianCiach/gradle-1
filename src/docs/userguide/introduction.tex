\chapter{Introduction}
We would like to introduce Gradle to you, a build system that we think is a quantum leap for build technology in the Java (JVM) world. Gradle provides:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a very flexible general purpose build tool like Ant.
    \item switchable, build-by-convention frameworks a la Maven. But we never lock you in!
    \item a very powerful support for multi-project builds.
    \item a very powerful dependency management (based on Apache Ivy). 
    \item full support for your existing Maven or Ivy repository infrastructure.
	\item (optionally) support for transitive dependency management without the need for remote repositories or \texttt{pom.xml} and \texttt{ivy.xml} files.
    \item Ant tasks as first class citizens.
    \item \emph{Groovy} build scripts. 
\end{itemize}
In chapter \ref{cha:overview} you find a detailed overview of Gradle. Now the tutorials are waiting, have fun :)
