<h1>API documentation</h1>

PLEASE NOTE! Gradle is written in Groovy, therefore we need to use the GroovyDoc tool to generate the api documentation.
GroovyDoc is work in progress. For example properties are not processed yet. Right now you might have to directly
look into the source code to get the
information you want. You might use <a href="http://svn.gradle.codehaus.org">Fisheye</a> for this. The source code is
also part of the Gradle distribution. - Apologies for the inconvenience
        
<ul>
    <li><a href="api/release">Current Release (${currentRelease})</a></li>
    <li><a href="api/latest">Latest (as usually uploaded by the latest successful nightly build)</a></li>
</ul>
