<h1>About Gradle</h1>
<p>
Gradle is a build system which uses Groovy instead of XML to write your build scripts.
</p>
Gradle gives you
<ul>
<li>a very flexible general purpose build tool like Ant.</li>
<li>if wanted, build-by-convention frameworks a la Maven (for example for Java projects). But we never lock you in!</li>
<li>a very powerful support for multi-project builds.</li>
<li>a very powerful dependency management (based on Ivy).</li>
<li>supports fully your existing Maven or Ivy repository infrastructure.</li>
<li>makes usings Ant tasks a bliss.</li>
</ul>
