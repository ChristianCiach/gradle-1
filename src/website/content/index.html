<h1>About Gradle</h1>
<p>
Gradle is a build system which provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a very flexible general purpose build tool like Ant.</li>
<li>switchable, build-by-convention frameworks a la Maven. But we never lock you in!</li>
<li>a very powerful support for multi-project builds.</li>
<li>a very powerful dependency management (based on Apache Ivy).</li>
<li>full support for your existing Maven or Ivy repository infrastructure.</li>
<li>(optionally) support for transitive dependency management without the need for remote repositories and <tt>pom.xml</tt>
    or <tt>ivy.xml</tt> files.</li>
<li>Ant tasks as first class citizens.</li>
<li><i>Groovy</i> build scripts.</li>
</ul>
